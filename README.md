   - Best practices analysis with examples
   - Project-specific rules file tailored for this assessment

3. **Insights & Learnings Documentation** (`docs/insights-and-learnings.md`)
   - What worked well and why
   - What didn't work and how I adapted
   - Key insights about AI agent collaboration
   - Technical learnings and reflections

### ⏳ Pending
1. **Tenx MCP Server Configuration** (`.vscode/mcp.json`)
   - Awaiting server URL, authentication method, and developer ID from 10 Academy
