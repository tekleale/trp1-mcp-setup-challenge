# GitHub Copilot Instructions for TRP 1 - MCP Setup Challenge

This project is part of the TRP 1 - MCP Setup Challenge assessment from 10 Academy.

## Project Context

Assessment project demonstrating MCP server configuration and AI agent rules optimization.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.12.10
- **IDE**: VS Code with Augment Agent & GitHub Copilot
- **Tools**: Git, MCP servers (Tenx MCP Analytics)
- **Documentation**: Markdown
- **OS**: Windows 11 (PowerShell)

## Code Style & Conventions

### Documentation
- Use clear, descriptive markdown formatting
- Keep files focused and concise
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include code examples in fenced blocks with language tags
- Add tables for structured comparisons

### File Organization
- Group related documentation in `docs/` directory
- Keep configuration files in appropriate locations (`.vscode/`, `.github/`, root)
- Use descriptive file names (kebab-case for markdown files)
- Maintain clear directory structure

### Git Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit logical units of work
- Document all significant changes
- Keep repository clean and organized

## Project Goals

1. **MCP Server Setup**: Configure Tenx MCP Analysis server for interaction logging
2. **Rules File Optimization**: Create effective AI agent rules based on best practices
3. **Documentation**: Thoroughly document the process, research, and insights

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

- ❌ Don't create files without explicit need
- ❌ Don't make documentation overly verbose
- ❌ Don't skip examples when explaining concepts
- ❌ Don't forget to update docs when things change
- ❌ Don't commit without testing
- ❌ Don't use vague commit messages

## Key Insights

- MCP enables AI agents to use external tools without modifying the agent itself
- Rules files should be short, specific, and example-driven
- Clear documentation helps AI agents understand context and produce better results
- Iterative refinement based on testing improves outcomes

## Notes

- Python 3.12.10 installed at: `C:\Users\tekleab.alemayehu\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe`
- Tenx MCP server configured at: `https://mcppulse.10academy.org/proxy`
- All work must be documented for assessment review
